# Narrative Engine

Implementing ideas from https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/ron-newcomb

With help of old-school "planner" AI I originally implemented for Inform 7: https://github.com/i7/extensions/blob/master/Ron%20Newcomb/Problem-Solving%20Characters.i7x

With rollup installed globally `npm i rollup --global`

`tsc && rollup --file build.js build/g1.js`

Pull up index.html, view F12 console

Or use `--watch` on both commands in 2 different windows

## notes

- need to separate the actions & reactions from the actual reporting to the user. Can't foreshadow a reaction unless the machinery runs to discover one.
